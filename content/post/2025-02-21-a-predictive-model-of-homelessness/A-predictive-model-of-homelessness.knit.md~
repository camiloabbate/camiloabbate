# Introduction

This project generates a model that will predict the number of homeless
people per capita in a given county in the United States. The period
considered in the analysis is from 2007 to 2019 and the states
considered are California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

## Institutional Background

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
the federal organization in charge of administering housing and urban
development laws. The HUD defines homelessness as an individual or
family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. In
the exploratory data analysis section we will show that homelessness is
more of an urban problem rather than rural.

The Point-in-Time (PIT) count is a count of sheltered and unsheltered
people experiencing homelessness. The HUD requires that each Continuum
of Care (CoC) nationwide conducts this count in the last ten days of
January (every year). A CoC can include multiple counties, please refer
to the appendix for a detailed note on how we dealt with differences
between county level and CoC counts. Data from the last fourteen years
suggests that most of the homeless population in the US are concentrated
in coastal states.

Our review of the current academic literature on homelessness suggests
that some of the main predictors of homelessness are unemployment and
poverty, and unstable living arrangements. As such we decided to
gather data on these factors to be used as potential covariates. We also consider various other factors that could potentially predict homelessness such as GDP and weather.

## Why is this model useful?

The count of homeless populations is a useful metric for state and local
governments to use when determining various policies, and is essential to ensuring that adequate aid is provided. Furthermore, understanding what factors predict homelessness give governments and other agencies more information to create new policies and legislation aimed at reducing homelessness.

## Loading Data and Packages

In order to predict the count of homeless people in these four states,
we built a panel containing various different data points that could
potentially be used as covariates. We gathered data on population,
unemployment rates, housing prices, GDP, weather, and other
environmental factors, to name a few. In the appendix we have a section
that cites all of these data sources. These sources include the BEA, US
census Bureau, and the BLS, among others.

A full copy of the codebook is included with our other files, but here
are some important variables we will return to throughout this report:

Dependent Variables:

-   `homeless_share_pop` : the number of homeless people per capita

-   `Salience`: a dummy variable indicating that at least 50% of the
    homeless in the county are unsheltered

$$
\text{Salience} = 
        \begin{cases}
1  & \text{if more than 50} \% \hspace{.2cm} \text{of the homeless in that county are unsheltered}   \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

Independent Variables:

-   `panel` : this includes our complete panel of possible variables to
    be used as indepnedent variables (4930 observations and 84
    variables)

-   `z_scores_scaled` : these variables are a subset of the 'panel'
    after performing PCA (4930 observations and 64 variables)

The structure of both data frames is similar: the variables between
columns 1 to 7 are not used as covariates, while the variables in the
middle are used as covariates:

-   In the `panel`dataframe, the variables from columns 8 to 37 are used
    as covariates

-   In the `z_scores_scaled` dataframe, the variables from columns 8 to
    17 are used as covariates

*Note: please refer to the codebook for a full list of all potential
covariates*

# Data Cleaning

This project required an extensive amount of data cleaning and web
scraping, which resulted in a bunch of different data files and R
scripts. So rather than including all of our data cleaning scripts here
we have submitted a link to our google drive where you can access all of our data and R scripts.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Now we can explore the data to get a better idea of how homelessness in the
US has evolved over the past fourteen years. 

Let us take a look at how the number of homeless people in the entire US
has changed over the years 2007-2019:
